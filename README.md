# Code-refactor

## Description

This code Refactor was created to change the codebase so that the Horiseon company website follows accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines.
To achieve the above goals, I have made some changes to the code as follows:
 - Added semantic HTML elements and made sure HTML elements follow a logical structure. 
 - Added a descriptive concise description to the title element
 - Added accessible ALT attribute for images and icon elements

The deployed website can be visited [here](https://anumrasheed.github.io/Code-refactor/)
